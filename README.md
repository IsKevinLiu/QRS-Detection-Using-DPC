# QRS-Detection-Using-DPC

A **Density Peak Clustering Algorithm** with **Peak Over the Threshold** Method for identification of QRS complexes in ECG Signals.

Note: We will continue to update this project as subsequent research progresses.

# Acknowledge 
We implemented the **POT** method based on the [Chuanbo Hua](https://github.com/cbhua/peak-over-threshold) code.
